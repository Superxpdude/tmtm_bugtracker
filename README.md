# GPNVG-18 Panoramic Night Vision Goggles   
#### by TAW_Teeha

>L3-GPNVG18 Night Vision Goggles are specialized to give their operator a wider Field of View by extending the the number of image intensifier tubes from two to four.
>This extended FOV will give any unit operating at night a significant advantage working in tight environments such as buildings or cockpits.
>
>Due to the advanced look of the goggles they would be perfect for any SOF kit you plan on making!

Mod doesn't seem to be abandoned (?) but the new version is nowhere to be found.
